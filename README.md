# Javascript Snippets

Last updated: 25-08-2012

This is just a repository for JS Snippets that are commonly used for projects.

It will be updated regularly as I find anything useful.

NOTE: Of course you would need [jQuery] installed before using any of these snippets. You might also need to install [Modernizr] for some of the snippets as well.

[jQuery]: http://www.jquery.com 
[Modernizr]: http://www.modernizr.com 

## List of snippets 

Included snippets are listed below: 

* `image check`: hide broken image inside elements. This is a must for Expression.
* `ellipsis`: this is useful for controlling the width and height of a container. You can specify the maximum character with "count" attribute. 
* `url vars`: grab a url variable and make use of it. 
* `scroll top`: back to top button. 
* `hover intent`: every navigation dropdown needs it. 
* `bold highlight header`: mostly used for Expression Title tag. 
* `background image`: turn <img> into background image so you can center/cropped it or put something on top.
* `even/odd menu`: ideal for tables. displays different color per table row. 
* `tabs`: tabs made with one article menu.
* `placeholder`: remember how IE doesn't have input placeholder? This will help you.
